This is a website for a museum.
        
## Description
In this project I set out to create a website for a Community Science Museum and making it intriguing for both kids and adults. I tried to make the website a bit interesting and fun for the younger audience with CSS, but keeping the informative pages clean and simple for the adults. I set out to make a home page, a how to get involved page, a contact page, a page planning a visit to the museum and a page for one of the exhibitions they were having. I learned improve my HTML, to get better at the DRY principle in CSS, how to make images stick when scrolling and a bit of animation using CSS.
